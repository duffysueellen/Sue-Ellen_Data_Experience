Welcome to my Data Experience github. 

The name says it all, but for emphasis, this github demonstrates my experience working in data analysis. 

You'll find my a short section about me with education, recent work history and resume.

On the second page you will find a sample of projects I authored while completing my Masters of Science in Data Analytics and Computational Social Science at UMass Amherst
