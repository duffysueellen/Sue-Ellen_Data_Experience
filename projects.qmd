Explored healthcare journeys of people who use drugs (PWUD) using synthetic electronic health records (EHR), mapping their patient, provider relationships.The average recovery journey for a PWUD lasts over ten years and involves 6 treatment episodes. This project serves as an introduction to understanding patient-provider encounters of PWUD and as a template for future analysis.
