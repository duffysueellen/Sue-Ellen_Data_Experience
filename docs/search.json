It provides a unique opportunity to explore machine learning in the context of health outcomes.\nThe dataset is available on the Harvard Dataverse: Link to Dataset \nResearch Question\nHow does the inclusion or exclusion of stroke-specific risk factors in electronic health records affect the ability of machine learning models to accurately predict stroke, considering both the accuracy of positive predictions (precision) and the ability to identify all true cases (recall)?\nData Overview\nThe dataset used in this project is part of Synthea’s synthetic stroke series and includes 30,000 patients, with a 1:3 ratio of stroke to non-stroke cases, with 25% of the patients resulting in stroke and 75% of the patients resulting in no stroke.\nSynthea generates data through simulations designed to reflect real-world healthcare scenarios, including symptom reporting, lab results, and diagnoses."
